# Brain-Image-Classification

One of the aims of this project was to apply data science techniques and in particular deep learning, for the classification and predicition of a disease or disorder using brain images. In addition, I aimed to explore and compare the classification of 3 Dimensional (3D) and 2 Dimensional brain images. The 3D brain image dataset is for people and with and without **Autism** and can be found here: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html

The 2D brain image is for people with **brain tumor** and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
